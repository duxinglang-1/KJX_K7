 *         mmi_frm_set_group_key_handler(xxx_hdlr, PresentAllKeys, KEY_EVENT_DOWN);
 *         It is needed to pay attention in QWERTY project, in order to make the

 *         framework cover the case if application wants to handle all keys in one key handler
 *         in qwerty project even though keys like KEY_A has not the key handler in fact.
 *         Application uses this mmi_frm_set_group_key_handler(xxx_hdlr, PresentAllKeys, KEY_EVENT_DOWN);

 *      3. using PresentAllDialerKeys as array
 *         This is the special implementation for UCM/video call in QWERTY project.
 *         Because in QWERTY project, there is KEY_W. So the UCM/Video call needs to
 *         handle KEY_W, but the app owner don't want to use translate key handler
 *         So we implement this.
 *         app uses this interface as the following,
 *         mmi_frm_set_group_key_handler(xxx_hdlr, PresentAllDialerKeys, TOTAL_DIALER_KEYS, KEY_EVENT_DOWN);
 *         In xxx_hdlr, app should filter the key he doesn't interest Because we will give all the keys

/*****************************************************************************
 * FUNCTION
 *  mmi_frm_exec_key_handler
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  Because of history reason, applications may call this function directly to
 *  invoke current key handler.
 *  There are mainly 2 kinds of using cases.
 *    1. Call this function in Pen down and pen up handler
 *    2. press key, then in key handler entry new screen, show category and record the key code
 *       then use this key code to call this function.
 * 
 *  If you use it, pay attention that 
 *      This interface will update key info 
 *      will call translate key handler and key handler
 *  If the translate key handler and key handler are changed by someone else,
 *  applications should cover this case.
 *
 *  This interface will happen to filter some key event, for example
 *  mmi_frm_exec_key_handler(XXX_CODE, KEY_EVENT_UP);
 *  mmi_frm_exec_key_handler(XXX_CODE, KEY_REPEAT);
 *  KEY_REPEAT will be filtered. It is for MAUI_01882849
 *
 *  However: mmi_frm_exec_key_handler(XXX_CODE, KEY_EVENT_DOWN);
 *           mmi_frm_exec_key_handler(XXX_CODE, KEY_EVENT_DOWN);
 *           The second down should not be filtered for the using case 2 above.
 *
 *
 *  If we design multiple key handler in the future, this function should be considered
 *  because in one of the multiple key handler, application may call this function,
 *  it will make the code hard to maintain.
 *
 *  It is hard to remove this interface.
 *

 * DESCRIPTION
 *  In a screen, show a category.  In the category, create a list.
 *  and in the list create a editor.
 *  we will define a variable to record the sequence of event sending.
 *  In the key proc, we will check this variable to make sure the sequence is right.
 *  we use user data to distinguish the test case
 * ========================================================================
 * TEST CASE1 - mmi_key_ut_evt_routing_full_path_test
 *  This test case is used to test the full path routing(No one stops the key routing).
 *
 *  The events sent sequence
