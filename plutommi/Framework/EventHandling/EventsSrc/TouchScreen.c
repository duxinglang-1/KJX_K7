 * FUNCTION
 *  mmi_pen_start_capture_strokes
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  Start to capture stroke inside the handwriting area.
 *
 *  This API is typically used in entry function of editor screen.
 *
 *  The points are en-queued in 'point_array' in the following format:
 * 
 *  Each point contains two 16-bit integers for x, y coordinates. Two strokes are separated with
 *  marker (0xffff, 0), and all strokes of one character are ended with (0xffff, 0xffff) by
 *  mmi_pen_end_strokes_of_character(). The parameter 'max_points' should also include the memory 
 *  used by markers.
 *  (x0, y0) (x1, y1) K (0xffff, 0), K(0xffff, 0), K(0xffff, 0xffff)
 *  
 *  We has the following types of stroke-based handler
 *  - Stroke Down
 *  - Stroke Move
 *  - Stroke Up
 *  However, it does not have Stroke Repeat handler.
 *  
 *  In single-block mode ('num_regions' > 1), it enters stroke-based mode when pen is down in 
 *  handwriting area and then moves across MMI_PEN_STROKE_MIN_OFFSET pixels.
 *
 *  In multi-block mode ('num_regions' > 1), it enters stroke-based mode immediately after pen 
 *  is down in handwriting area.
 * 
 *  Note: the parameter 'ext_region' can only be used in single-block mode.
 * 
 * PARAMETERS
 *  max_points          :[IN]        Maximum number of points can be en-queued.
 *  point_array         :[IN]        Array for storing sampled points in strokes.

 * FUNCTION

 * DESCRIPTION
 *  This function is used to disable stroke events in single-block Handwriting

 *  To design this API is to disable stroke events when pen is down in an area,
 *  where IME will hope to receive pen events instead of stroke events.
 *  The mechanism is based on the original single block pen event mechanism.
 *  That is.
 *    stroke down => pen down
 *    stroke move => pen move if stroke move offset > MMI_PEN_SKIP_MOVE_OFFSET
 *    if square(stroke move offset) > g_pen_stroke_min_offset_square = square(MMI_PEN_STROKE_MIN_OFFSET)
 *    stroke move => pen abort stroke down stroke move
 *
 *  So this API sets the g_pen_stroke_min_offset as 0x7FFF to make sure
 *  stroke move offset will always < g_pen_stroke_min_offset to implement
 *  disable stroke events in the whole touch panel.
